Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to present data in a visual way that can be explained to the audience in which ways biking in New York differs between Gender, Time etc.

Summary:
Based off of the results males tend to bike more often than women. The number of males that checkout bikes doubles the number of women that checkout bikes. I would add the demographic of high male areas in New York, also adding where people in New York tend to bike so that you can see the hotspot areas.
